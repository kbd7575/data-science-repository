## About Me

I'm a data scientist with a background in chemical manufacturing and process design engineering. I have extensive experience in building chemical engineering models, designing case studies and plant tests, technical calculations, and data anaysis. I also bring over a decade of project execution experience to the table. Now I would like to apply my analytical and technical skills to solving real-world challenges in pharmaceuticals, life sciences, and industrial data environments.

This portfolio showcases practical applications of machine learning, predictive analytics, and data visualization.

## Projects

### [Manufacturing Defect Detection](./Manufacturing Defect Detection)
> Manufacturing | Regression | Classification | Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression | Feature Engineering
Developed a binary classification model to identify defective materials. Compared performance of 3 baseline models with no feature engineering and 3 models with feature engineering. Selected final model based on high performance in all metrics espeically recall (which  is assumed the most important metric as it represents the model’s ability to correctly identify defective materials). Baseline LightGBM achieved 0.95 recall and 0.85 ROC AUC.

### [Domestic Violence EDA and Risk Assessment](./Domestic Violence Risk Assessment)
> Data Visualization | EDA | Classification | Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Decision Tree
Analyzed data to determine what demographic and socio-economic factors put the women in a specific community at the most risk for domestic violence.

### [Jane Street Market Prediction](./jane-street-responder6)
> Time Series Forecasting | Financial ML | XGBoost, Feature Engineering  
Used 47M-row anonymized market dataset from Kaggle to predict a noisy regression target (`responder_6`). Achieved R² of 0.0129 with tuned ensemble models.

### [Diabetes Risk Classification](./diabetes-prediction)
> Healthcare | Classification | Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
Developed a binary classification model to identify likely undiagnosed diabetes cases using medical record data. Highest F1 Score: 0.91.

---

### [Olympics Data Analysis](./olympics-eda)
> Data Visualization | EDA | Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Explored 120 years of Olympic data to analyze gender participation, medal distribution, and event growth using visual storytelling techniques.
